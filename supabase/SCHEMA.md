# DZpatch V2.0 — Database Schema Reference

## Overview
- **26 tables**, **17 ENUMs**, **40+ indexes**, **15 auto-update triggers**
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension (spatial queries)
- All wallet mutations via database-level transactions
- Idempotent payment processing via unique `reference` on transactions

## Key Design Decisions

1. **One role per account** — no multi-role. A user is customer OR rider OR fleet_manager OR admin.
2. **Wallet balance >= 0** — enforced by CHECK constraint at database level.
3. **Commission-lock** — `riders.unpaid_commission_count` tracks unpaid orders; `is_commission_locked` blocks new orders.
4. **Idempotent payments** — `transactions.reference` is UNIQUE. Duplicate Paystack webhooks are rejected.
5. **Polymorphic wallets** — `wallet_owner_type` + `owner_id` allows one table for all wallet types.
6. **Order = single source of truth** — all status transitions happen in `orders.status`; clients react, never drive.
7. **Offline GPS sync** — `rider_location_logs` has `recorded_at` (device) vs `synced_at` (server) + `sequence_number` for dedup.
8. **Commission snapshot** — commission rates are frozen on `orders` at creation time, not looked up dynamically.
